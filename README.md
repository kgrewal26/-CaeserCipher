# -CaeserCipher
A personal project that can encrypt and decrypt simple messages and text files. 

To start using the cipher, launch the ".jar" file 

Selecting a language is neccessary for the entire program. This can be done in the "Settings" tab of the application, and can be changed whenever you desire.

Now, you can encrypt any message of files you wish, but in order to decrypt, another step is neccessary: a database of words needs to be uploaded.

Head over to the "Explore Database" tab. You can upload a database for a certain language here. You could train your own file, but I've also attached some sample Database files that I've trained myself. Those can be found in the "Database Files" folder in the repository.

Now, you can decrypt messages for a given language. Please note that the decryptor is not perfect, and can't work in every single situation.

Incase you want to train your own database file, I've attached various training files to help. These can be found in the "Training Text Files" folder in the repository.

In addition to all of this, the actual code can be found in the "Cipher GUI" and "Ciphering Algorithms" folders in the repository.

I hope you enjoy!
